# get_asv_reads
Function to pull out all of the reads that make up an ASV produced from the DADA2 pipeline

This is not actually a function yet, but you can use it easily. This took me a while to figure out how to do this, but it was necessary for me to 
understand the reads which composed a given ASV. I hope this makes your life a little easier!
